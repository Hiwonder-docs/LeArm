Do not use lithium batteries or any power supply with a total voltage higher than 5V. Also, make sure not to reverse the positive and negative terminals when inserting the batteries.
:::

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_15/section_1/04/media/image2.png" class="common_img" style="width:500px;"/>

*   **Program Download**

[Source Code](../_static/source_code/LeArm_Synchronization_Controller_Course.zip)

(1) Connect the controller to the computer using a USB cable.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_15/section_1/04/media/image3.png" class="common_img" />

(2) In the [Factory Firmware Program->Sync](Appendix.md) folder located in the same path as this document, find the corresponding example project file.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_15/section_1/04/media/image4.png" class="common_img" />

(3) Select the development board model when you open the program, and the specific model is shown in the figure below.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_15/section_1/04/media/image5.png" class="common_img" />

(4) Select the development board and processor model as shown in the figure.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_15/section_1/04/media/image6.png" class="common_img" />

(5) Click **"Compile"** first, then click **"Upload"**. After the upload is completed, the program download is completed if the following interface appears in the output box below the software.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_15/section_1/04/media/image7.png" class="common_img" />

*   **Device Connection**

(1) Step 1: Place the synchronization controller on a smooth table surface using the suction cup and secure it.

:::{Note}
Make sure the suction cup is firmly attached to a smooth surface to prevent instability, tipping over, or falling during operation.
:::

(2) Step 2: Turn on the robotic arm first, then turn on the synchronization controller.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_15/section_1/04/media/image8.png" class="common_img" style="width:600px;"/>

(3) Step 3: The indicator light on the Bluetooth module of the synchronization controller control board will start blinking, indicating that the device is not yet connected.

(4) Step 4: For initial pairing, briefly press the **"DEL"** button on the synchronization controller control board, located next to the Bluetooth module.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_15/section_1/04/media/image9.png" class="common_img" style="width:600px;"/>

(5) Step 5: Wait for 2 seconds. The synchronization controller and the LeArm AI will automatically pair. Once paired successfully, the indicator light on the Bluetooth module of the synchronization controller control board will remain steadily on. From then on, both devices will automatically pair when powered on, without the need to press the **"DEL"** button again.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_15/section_1/04/media/image10.png" class="common_img" style="width:600px;"/>

:::{Note}
If pairing fails, you can press the **"DEL"** button on the synchronization controller control board again to retry. Additionally, if you need to pair with another device, such as a different LeArm AI robotic arm or the Tankbot robot, you must press the **"DEL"** button after powering on to clear the previous pairing.
:::

*   **Mode Selection**

:::{Note}
When using the synchronization controller to control a robot, only one-to-one control is allowed. It is not possible to operate in a one-to-many configuration or to control multiple devices simultaneously, if you have purchased all three devices mentioned above.

Additionally, before entering the corresponding mode, please press the **"DEL"** button to ensure the devices are successfully connected before proceeding with the operations in this section.
:::

The factory firmware of the synchronization controller supports four control modes: Tankbot, xArm, LeArm AI, and WonderArm.

| **No.** | **Control Mode** | **LED Indicator Pattern** |
|:---:|:---:|:---|
| 1 | Tankbot (default mode) | LED1 flashes once in a repeating cycle |
| 2 | xArm | LED1 flashes twice in a repeating cycle |
| 3 | LeArm AI | LED1 flashes three times in a repeating cycle |
| 4 | WonderArm | LED1 flashes four times in a repeating cycle |

**"KEY1"** is used to select the mode, and **"KEY2"** is used to confirm and enter the selected mode. After choosing the desired mode, press **"KEY2"** to confirm and enter.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_15/section_1/04/media/image11.png" class="common_img" style="width:600px;"/>

In this section, we will control the LeArm AI robotic arm. According to the table above, we know that after powering on, the synchronization controller defaults to the Tankbot control mode.

Therefore, after successfully pairing with the device, press the **"KEY1"** button twice until LED1 flashes three times in a repeating cycle, indicating that it has successfully switched to the LeArm AI robotic arm control mode. Finally, press the **"KEY2"** button to confirm and enter this mode.

:::{Note}
If you accidentally press **"KEY1"** and switch to another mode, you can press **"KEY1"** again. When LED1 flashes twice in a repeating cycle, it has switched back to the xArm robotic arm control mode.
:::

*   **Diagram**

By rotating or moving the potentiometers on the synchronization controller, the corresponding servos on the LeArm AI robotic arm will execute the same movements in real time.

Each potentiometer on the synchronization controller corresponds one-to-one with a specific servo on the robotic arm. For example, potentiometer 1 on the synchronization controller controls servo 1 on the LeArm AI, and so on.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_15/section_1/04/media/image12.png" class="common_img" />

:::{Note}
When using the robotic arm, make sure to keep it away from your body to avoid accidental injury. Additionally, operate it slowly and carefully whenever possible.
:::

The joystick module on the back of the synchronization controller is reserved for advanced development. For example, you can add a mobile chassis and modify the program according to their own needs, which requires basic development skills.

### 15.2.5 Project Outcome 

First, turn on the robotic arm first, then turn on the synchronizer. If the synchronization controller 's Bluetooth module indicator is flashing, briefly press the **"DEL"** button next to the Bluetooth module. Wait a moment for the two devices to automatically pair. Once the indicator stays solid, pairing is successful.

After successfully pairing with the device, press the **"KEY1"** button twice until LED1 flashes three times in a repeating cycle, indicating that it has successfully switched to the LeArm AI robotic arm control mode. Finally, press the **"KEY2"** button to confirm and enter this mode.

By rotating or moving the potentiometers on the synchronization controller, the corresponding servos on the robotic arm will execute the same movements in real time. Each potentiometer on the synchronization controller corresponds one-to-one with a specific servo on the robotic arm. For example, potentiometer 1 on the synchronization controller controls servo No. 1 on the LeArm AI, and so on.

### 15.2.6 Program Brief Analysis 

:::{Note}
The synchronization controller communicates with the robotic arm via Bluetooth. The command frame format, protocol parsing, and control logic are consistent with the **"App Control"** section in the Basic Development Course. Please refer to that section for more details. The explanation here focuses on specific implementation details.
:::

(1) ino File (Application Layer)

{lineno-start=1}
```python
#include "Config.h"
#include "Hiwonder.hpp"
#include "Robot_arm.hpp"
#include "./src/PC_BLE/PC_BLE_CTL.hpp"

Led_t led_obj;
Buzzer_t buzzer_obj;
LeArm_t arm;
PC_BLE_CTL pc_ble_obj;

void setup() {
  delay(1000);
  pinMode(IO_BLE_CTL, OUTPUT);
  digitalWrite(IO_BLE_CTL, HIGH);  // Set the Bluetooth control pin to low level to cut off the Bluetooth module power (设置蓝牙控制引脚为低电平时，断开蓝牙模块电源)

  arm.init();
  led_obj.init(IO_LED);
  buzzer_obj.init(IO_BUZZER);

  Serial.begin(9600);
  delay(2000);

  pc_ble_obj.init(1);

  buzzer_obj.blink(1500, 100, 100, 1);
}

void loop() {
  pc_ble_obj.PC_BLE_Task(&arm , &led_obj , &buzzer_obj);
}
```

① Import the following libraries: `config.h`, `Hiwonder.hpp`, `Robot_arm.hpp`, and `PC_BLE_CTL.hpp`. The `Robot_arm.hpp` file contains the definition of the robotic arm object, while `PC_BLE_CTL.hpp` includes the definition of the Bluetooth receiver object.

② Objects for the LED, buzzer, robotic arm, and Bluetooth receiver are created for later use in control operations.

③ In the `setup()` function,first delay for 1000 ms (1 second), then power off the Bluetooth module. Next, initialize the robotic arm, LED, and buzzer objects, then open the serial port and set the baud rate to 9600.
The Bluetooth receiver object is initialized, and the buzzer beeps once for feedback.

④ In the main loop, the Bluetooth receiver controller is activated.

(2) PC_BLE_CTL.cpp File (Low-Level)

① PC_BLE_Task – Main Bluetooth Receiver Function

Within the main Bluetooth control function, the `unpack()` method is first called to decode incoming Bluetooth data. If decoding is successful, the command field (`packet.cmd`) is checked to determine which action to perform.

The synchronization controller controls the rotation of multiple servos in the robotic arm. At the communication protocol level, it sends command frames of the type "**Control Single/Multiple Servo PWM**", which corresponds to Function Code 3 in the message definition. When `case 3` is triggered, the control mode is set to `APP_FUNC_MULT_SERVO_MOVE`.

{lineno-start=21}
```python
typedef enum
{
	APP_VERSION_QUERY = 1, //Firmware query (固件查询)
	APP_SERVO_OFFSET_READ, //Read servo offset (舵机偏差读取)
	APP_MULT_SERVO_MOVE, //Control single/multiple servo pulse width (控制单/多个舵机脉宽)
```

Within the `APP_MULT_SERVO_MOVE` branch, the number of servos to control and the motion duration are extracted from the data packet. A loop iterates through the packet to read each servo's ID and duty cycle. The `knot_run()` function is then called to control the corresponding servo motor based on the parsed values.
